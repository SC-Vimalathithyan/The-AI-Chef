# The-AI-Chef
People and industries lack intelligent, personalized solutions for cooking, creative work, and innovation. Key issues include poor recipe personalization, no ingredient/nutrition support, limited AI collaboration, weak content verification, and slow, data-heavy drug discovery. 

This project is a full-stack MVP for an AI-powered recipe generator. It allows users to input ingredients, apply dietary filters, and receive personalized recipes with nutrition info.
